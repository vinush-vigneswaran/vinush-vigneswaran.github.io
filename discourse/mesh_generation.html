              <div class="subheading"><b>What is a Mesh?</b></div><br>
                <div class="section">
                  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_generation">mesh</a> is a collection of vertices, edges and 
                  faces to represent a 3D model of an object or system. These 3D models can be a volume or even a surface 
                  (e.g. a hyperlplane). One way of thinking of meshes, is that it represents
                  a continuous geometric space in the real world, with discrete geometrical cells on a computer. 
                  <br><br>
                  Computational modelling is very useful in scientific communities to simulate and study complex systems. 
                  These 3D models can be used for analysis and simulations by visualising a certain property about the object or 
                  system under test. A common use of 3D models is to observe the property (e.g. fluid behaviour, wave propagation, 
                  thermal attributes etc.) as a projection on the surface of the mesh in the form of a colour gradient. 
                  In CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics), these meshes can be used to predict fluid-flow and heat transfers around 
                  the object. This method is often used for the design of aerodynamic vehicles.

                  <a href="https://vtk.org/">VTK</a>, the Visualisation Toolkit, 
                  is a popular open-source software for 3D modelling and scientific visualisation. 
                  VTK was developed in C++ and offers flavours in other languages such as JavaScript, C# and even Python 
                  (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/vtk/">vtk Python</a>). 
                  <br><br>
                  <a href="https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/">PyVista</a> library allows the VTK library to be used in a pythonic matter, by providing a wrapper for VTK data types. 
                  This means being able to use numpy data objects to create the mesh and plot with minimal code. 
                  <!-- <br><br>
                  Below you can see an example of the effort needed to plot a mesh using VTK library vs PyVista library

                    Let’s say your tutor was on the phone with you, helping you with your school homework. 
                    They wanted you to plot a coloured scatter graph on a graph paper, with red and blue dots. 
                    They would need to give you two pieces of information: 
                    <ul>
                      <li>the coordinates of the points</li>
                      <li>the colour of each point</li>
                    </ul>
                    As the second part of the homework, the teacher wanted you to draw the points and connect these 
                    points to create an image of a cat, like a connect-the-dot exercise. In this case, the teacher needs 
                    to provide you with one more piece of information:
                    <ul>
                      <li>the connection between each point (i.e. the edge)</li>
                    </ul>
                    And if the teacher wanted you to colour each of the segments (i.e the face) created by the connections 
                    (for example, the whiskers of the cat should be black), then you may need another piece of information 
                    to map a colour to each segment.
                </div><br>


                <div class="section">
                  Creating a mesh through PyVista is pretty much the same process as what is described above.
                  <br>
                  Let’s assume we want to plot a point cloud (a 3D scatter graph). To “draw” the points you would need the 
                  Cartesian coordinates of each point cloud (x, y, z). If you wanted to connect these 3D points to form a gridded mesh, 
                  you would need the connectivity between the points.
                  <br>
                  A cell is a fundamental geometrical unit, that when combined forms the entire mesh – 
                  a bit like the Lego piece that forms the Lego castle. Each cell is defined by the connecting points and 
                  the edges that connect them. 

                  <ul>
                    <li>the coordinates of the points</li>
                    <li>the colour of each point</li>
                  </ul>
                  As the second part of the homework, the teacher wanted you to draw the points and connect these 
                  points to create an image of a cat, like a connect-the-dot exercise. In this case, the teacher needs 
                  to provide you with one more piece of information:
                  <ul>
                    <li>the connection between each point (i.e. the edge)</li>
                  </ul>
                  And if the teacher wanted you to colour each of the segments (i.e the face) created by the connections 
                  (for example, the whiskers of the cat should be black), then you may need another piece of information 
                  to map a colour to each segment.
