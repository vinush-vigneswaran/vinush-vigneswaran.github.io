                  <ul><br>
                    <li>Compounding creeps up. The idea of "compounding interest" is unintuitive to humans - 
                      we are very linear thinking creatures. 
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Consistently unwavering investments are critical to your financial survival during tail events 
                      (major economic downturns) in the long run.
                    </li><br>
                    <li> You don't need a reason to save your money - there are always going to be unplanned catastrophic events
                      and having the money to sustain yourself during those times gives you enough leeway to say no to a desperate, sub-optimal next-step.
                    </li><br>
                    <li> There is always a chance of your plan not going to plan, so your job is to balance risk, luck and skill. Even if a potential profit 
                      is crazy good, but if the risk will wipe you out - then it is not a risk worth taking.
                    </li><br>
                    <li> What is enough for you? Learn to stop moving your goal post. Otherwise you will be constantly chasing, and indefinitely unhappy.
                    </li><br>    
                    <li>Wealth is what you don't see. More spending to show people what you have = less money.
                    </li><br> 
                    <li>Wealth gives you more control of your life decisions - you are not forced to get the next available job in a field you don't like, with people you 
                      don't like. It gives you leeway to pick and choose, but also allows you to make more mistakes without 
                      wiping you out.
                    </li><br>    
                    <li>It's hard to always be <i>rational</i> with money, we are only humans. 
                      It's enough to be <i>reasonable</i>.
                    </li><br>    
                    <li>"Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays". 
                    </li><br>          
                    <li>"Your personal experience with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what is happening in the world, but
                      maybe 80% of how you think the world works." 
                    </li><br>                                
                  </ul>
