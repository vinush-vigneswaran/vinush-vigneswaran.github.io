                    The aim of this piece of writing is to summarise important 
                    concepts covered in deep learning. A lot of engineers I have 
                    worked with implement deep learning models as a "black box" or 
                    more fittingly a "magic box", where the purpose is simply to
                    change the hyperparameters and obtain a sufficiently "good" accuracy. 
                    Unfortunately, this method <em>does work</em> (to some extent). The 
                    real issue is software engineers do not understand deep learning models 
                    enough to realise when <b>not</b> to use it. In order to make some real 
                    strides in general AI and AI research, we need to understand why deep 
                    learning works and develop an intuition for the underlying mathematics.
                    <br><br>
                    This piece of writing will attempt to do that.

                    The main source of information is from the "Deep Learning" textbook 
                    by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville. My reference 
                    for the the code and code explanation comes from the official
                    TensorFlow documentation.

                    Lorem IpsumÂ is simply dummy text of the printing and 
                    typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 
                    took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic 
                    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 
                    1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
                    including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
