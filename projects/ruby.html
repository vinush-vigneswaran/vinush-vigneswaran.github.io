                    A virtual assistant application which integrates Google's cloud speech-to-text 
                    to recognise user's command and text-to-speech API to generate a virtual voice. The GUI was created 
                    using Tkinter and Rainmeter (for wallpaper visuals). This system was integrated with 
                    Arduino for home automation, such that the lights and motorised blinds were controlled by voice.

                    Lorem IpsumÂ is simply dummy text of the printing and 
                    typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 
                    took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic 
                    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 
                    1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
                    including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
