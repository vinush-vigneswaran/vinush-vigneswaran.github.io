                    <p>Formula Student is a student engineering competition held annually in the UK. 
                    Student teams from around the world design, build, test, and race a small-scale 
                    formula style racing car.</p>
                    
                    <p>UBeRacing is the University of Birminghamâ€™s electric Formula Student Team. 
                    We are a society of over 40 individuals working together to produce an electric single 
                    seat racing car. UBeR was started at the beginning of 2017 
                    to provide a fun, rewarding and competitive experience to engineers looking to go into 
                    the electrical automotive industry, and a great time for everyone involved. </p>

                <div class="section">
                    <p>In 2019, huge progress was made in designing the FS2020 racing car and preparing 
                    to enter the Class 1 competition - progressing from the concept class.
                    Work was going well under way, with deliveries for parts finally coming in, and sponsorships
                    from well-established engineering companies started to roll in.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, with the pandemic, access to the University labs were restricted, 
                    deliveries were much slower and funds were only trickling in.</p>

                    <p>Suddenly, all work came to an abrupt halt. The competition was cancelled.</p>

                    <p>Regardless, we decided to focus on the designs improving the chassis, further 
                    developping the vehicle dynamics and making our simulations more accurate for next year.</p>
