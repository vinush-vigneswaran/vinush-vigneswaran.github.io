                    The Commuter Lambda Air is a hybrid light aircraft, replacing conventional cars. The aircraft
                    is designed for vertical take-off and landing. Introducing a new dimension to private transport
                    at a price tag similar to a luxury car. The
                    Lambda Air is reliable, eco-friendly and sustainable.

                    The aircraft can hold up to 5 passengers and extra accessories. The fuselage internals 
                    can be modified for load transport, such as food, water and medical supply for humanitarian missions. 
                    The aircraft can cruise at low altitudes at around 200-250 mph, with a 
                    range of up to 1000 miles.

                    A hybrid power system is implemented in this design which contains hydrogen peroxide fuel
                    cells, Li-battery and diesel fuel cells. Closed loop controlled methods are applied to 
                    stabilize the operations of the subsystems, and the
                    behaviour of DC and AC loads are constantly monitored.

                <div class="section">
                    The aircraft is able to conduct VTOL (vertical take-off and
                    landing) using the 48 fans located on the wings, with 270 degree rotational capability. VTOL reduces the load
                    on the landing gear, and significantly extends the life-cycle of the landing gear components. However,
                    during emergency situations, such as failure in the fan or power, the aircraft will be able to use backup
                    power to autonomously land the aircraft using CTOL (conventional take-off and landing).

                <div class="section">
                    The objective of the landing gear design, is to utilise light
                    materials and effective design to achieve efficient, low mass flight, whilst reducing cost of manufacturing. 
                    As this is a small aircraft, a retractable landing gear would decrease the drag significantly during flight, as the landing
                    gear accounts for approximately 18% of the frontal area.

                    The landing gear was redesigned to improve the quality, reduce material waste and increase safety, whilst 
                    facilitating for an automated manufacturing process.

                    The factor of safety for the strut and the wheel bracket, 28.7 and 10.8 respectively, 
                    exceeds the recommended aircraft safety factor of 1.5 to 2.5. A lower factor safety 
                    was achieved by changing the material in correspondence to a lower yield strength.

                    The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) shows that the high stresses have been reduced significantly from the previous design. 
                    The revised shock strut design, had a maximum stress of 2.42 MPa, compared to the previous 12.2 MPa (80.1% reduction), 
                    and a new factor of safety of 2.1. The revised wheel bracket design has a maximum stress of 18.6 MPa, and the yield 
                    strength of the wheel is 27.5 MPa (1350 Aluminium Alloy). The maximum stress has decreased by 41.9%. The wheel 
                    bracket has a safety factor of 1.5.
                    The yield strength of the wheel is 27.5 MPa (1350 Aluminium Alloy), 
                    however maximum fatigue shown on the wheel bracket is 18.6 MPa, therefore failure is minimised.
