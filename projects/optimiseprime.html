                    Data centre industry accounts for around 4% of global electricity consumption and 1% of global greenhouse gas emission. 
                    A lot of companies using cloud solutions use more resources than they need.

                    In a short 24-hour period, my team and I have developed a recommender system, that allows user to optimise their efficiency in 
                    utilising AWS cloud resources, reduce energy usage significantly and cut costs. Our solution directly tackles the large carbon 
                    emission brought by cloud usages, which is applicable to any user or company that uses cloud.

                    Our recommender system looks at the resources and performance data of your current cloud infrastructure and suggests a more efficient strategy.

                        <li>Our recommender system looks through 1000s of available services in AWS to best recommend a better strategy without compromising performance or functionality.</li>
                        <li>The data and the metrics are all presented on an easy-to-use dashboard.</li>

                    Lorem IpsumÂ is simply dummy text of the printing and 
                    typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 
                    took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic 
                    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 
                    1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
                    including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
