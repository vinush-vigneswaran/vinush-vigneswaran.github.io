                <div class="subheading"><b>Abstract</b></div><br>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>Storytelling  is a powerful mechanism for communication that is central to human socialising 
                    and information transfer. As such this project introduces a novel collaborative visual storytelling 
                    task; Collaborative Question-guided Visual Storytelling (CQ-VS). The task involves the user asking 
                    multi-turn questions based on an image, and the model generates a continuation of a coherent narrative 
                    as a response, thus the user guides the story according to their interest – imitating human interactions 
                    during storytelling. This task is an extension of the popular Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, 
                    however, for CQ-VS in order to answer the question, the model must attend to three inputs; the question, 
                    the generated story and the image.</p> 

                    <p>This project introduces a benchmark model leveraging state-of-the art VQA systems, using an encoder-decoder 
                    story generation model, and a history modelling technique to achieve user interactions. The focus of the 
                    project is directed towards the quality of the generated story, the user experience, and the impact of 
                    this application on helping users write creative stories. Three automatic metrics are proposed to evaluate 
                    fluency, coherence and lexical diversity. Whereby, perplexity is computed using an n-gram language model, 
                    to compare fluency of generated text with human-authored text. The coherence metric leverages sentence 
                    embeddings generated as part of the story generation model to compute semantic relatedness between 
                    sentences. We show that the proposed automatic coherence metric strongly correlates with human judgement 
                    rating, with a Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient of 0.76. Additionally, the analysis of the user study 
                    shows great interest in the application, and collective exuberance towards the potential of this novel 
                    application. Although, major improvements are required in the technical aspects.</p>
                    
                    <p>Throughout this report we expose potential improvements in the design and implementation 
                    of this system and the user study, to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. 
                    The proposed baseline model provides a constructive foundation for future work.</p>

                    <p>“The value of information does not survive the moment in which it was new. 
                        It lives only at that moment; it has to surrender to it completely and explain 
                        itself to it without losing any time. A story is different. It does not expend 
                        itself. It preserves and concentrates its strength and is capable of releasing 
                        it even after a long time.”</p> – Walter Benjamin
