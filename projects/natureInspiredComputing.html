                    <p>Environmental as well as economic issues provide a compelling impetus to develop clean, 
                        efficient, and sustainable vehicles. The promise for highly efficient, and low emission 
                        individual transportation is represented by Plug-In Hybrid-Electric Vehicles (PHEV), by 
                        shifting the demand from crude oil to electricity.</p>
                        
                        <p>This paper presents an intelligent energy 
                        management strategy for a series PHEVs by developing a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). 
                        A detailed description of developing a FLC, based on vehicle dynamics and internal power 
                        distribution, is provided. Fuzzy logic provides a suitable method for realising an optimal 
                        trade-off between the efficiencies of all components of the PHEV, however, this strategy 
                        provides limited sub-optimal solutions. Therefore, the FL control actions and rules, 
                        are developed using accelerated Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), to achieve global 
                        optimisation.</p>
                        
                        <p>The objective of the PSO algorithm is to minimise the energy cost during 
                        vehicle operation whilst maintaining the batteryâ€™s State-of-Charge (SoC), therefore 
                        increasing fuel economy and system efficiency. The FLC is optimised offline using real 
                        vehicle data (BMW i3), to train the model. In order to validate the optimisation strategy, 
                        the PSO FL will be compared with other prominent optimisation strategies; Genetic Algorithm (GA), 
                        Simulated Annealing (SA), PSO and Pattern Search (PS) hybrid. An analysis on the fuel economy 
                        and system efficiency indicates PSO and PSO-PS outperforms GA and SA. PSO FL based strategy 
                        improves the range of the vehicle for the NEDC drive cycle by 3.49 % and the system efficiency 
                        increases by 8.9 %.</p>
